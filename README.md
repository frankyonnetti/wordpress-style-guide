# Wordpress Style Guide `Code`

When starting new theme builds in Drupal, one of the initial modules I always install is the [Style Guide](https://www.drupal.org/project/styleguide) module. Unfortunately I cannot find an equivalent for Wordpress. So I copied and modified their template filled with example code and created a new file `theme-style-guide.html`. 

Simply create a new page in Wordpress and copy the code from `theme-style-guide.html` into the body field and save.
